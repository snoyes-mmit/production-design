Please adjust the following areas of the Nostella Formulary Template in both html files, one is written for our digital and printable (PDF) version and the other our email:

Reverse the order of the header section. Instead of the logo on the right, design would like the logo on the left and the 'Local Coverage Update' to the right.

Adjust the border radius on the 'Local Coverage Update' container so the curved edge is on the lower right-side corner.

Update the 'Channel' and 'Coverage' headers color from its current #d3d3d3 hex value to #58595b.

Add 40px of margin above the table grid and below the 'source' information below the table grid.
